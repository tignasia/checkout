Requirements:
·         Design and implement supermarket checkout component with readable API that calculates the total price of a number of items.

·         Checkout mechanism can scan items and return actual price (is stateful)

·         Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multi-priced: "buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y cents"

  Item   Unit      Special
              Price     Price
  --------------------------
    A        40       3 for 70
    B        10       2 for 15
    C        30
    D        25
We value:
·         simple, elegant code that reads like a narrative – don't overcomplicate

·         excellent testing that acts as documentation

·         challenging boundaries where necessary


Additional notes:
·         use maven or gradle build system

·         make task available on the public GitHub

·         if in doubt please document your design choice in README file
